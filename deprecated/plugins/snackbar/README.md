Invokes Seekbar.

Apparently some distros can't do this via hotkey.

## Description

Just what it says on the tin - apparently some of the Enigma2 distros don't
support arrow right to invoke the seekbar, either directly or via a hotkey.
With this plugin, you can just bind the arrow right key with the long trigger
to the plugin to get that functionality. This seems especially useful when
watching VOD streams.

## Settings

None! Why would it need any?
