to help with testing, provide ideas and all kind of suggestions or comments!

* [Absolut](https://github.com/oottppxx/enigma2/tree/master/plugins/absolut) is a VODka plugin, supporting XCAPI.

* [AutoOff](https://github.com/oottppxx/enigma2/tree/master/plugins/autooff) attempts to stop any service after the box goes to standby, and optionally tries to resume the service afterwards - apparently some images don't do it by default, so if you want to confirm, just activate debug and check the debug log. It also supports running commands when entering and exiting standby.

* [Budweiser](https://github.com/oottppxx/enigma2/tree/master/plugins/budweiser) is a simple (and still experimental) audio dubber/PiP.

* [Buzzz](https://github.com/oottppxx/enigma2/tree/master/plugins/buzzz) is a local M3U proxy for TheHive.

* [ColaCao](https://github.com/oottppxx/enigma2/tree/master/plugins/colacao) is a very simple line editor.
  NOTE: it overwrites files without asking and without making a backup!

* [Frenchs](https://github.com/oottppxx/enigma2/tree/master/plugins/frenchs) adds some spice to Heinz (see below), marking catchup supporting channels as the M3U download is proxied through it; it supports XCAPI and VAPI.

* [Heinz](https://github.com/oottppxx/enigma2/tree/master/plugins/heinz) is a "ketchup" plugin, supporting (a couple of variants of) XCAPI and VAPI.

* [Innocent](https://github.com/oottppxx/enigma2/tree/master/plugins/innocent) is a local M3U proxy for SmoothStreams.
  See [this guide](https://github.com/oottppxx/enigma2/tree/master/docs/SSSetupGuideOnE2.pdf) by @asondj (thanks!) on how to set it up (using Suls).

* [Line](https://github.com/oottppxx/enigma2/tree/master/plugins/line) is a plugin that automatically hides or show (per setting) the VBI artifacts covering screen (black line at the top of the image); it can be set differently for IPTV and for DVB-C/T/S services. If the need arises to toggle the line within a service, just invoke the plugin via hotkey (the menus will just take you to setup).

* [Love](https://github.com/oottppxx/enigma2/tree/master/plugins/love) is a plugin that adds the current service to the TV favourites bouquet. It requires to be invoked via hotkey for any useful action, otherwise it goes to setup (making it a 1-key favouriting machine) - tested on OpenATV 6.2 only!

* [McDonnells](https://github.com/oottppxx/enigma2/tree/master/plugins/mcdonnells) is an events lister/zapper for SmoothStreams and VAPI MatchCenter.
  See [this guide](https://github.com/oottppxx/enigma2/tree/master/docs/SSSetupGuideOnE2.pdf) by @asondj (thanks!) on how to set it up.

* [MiracleWhip](https://github.com/oottppxx/enigma2/tree/master/plugins/miraclewhip) is a plugin to edit Suls/IPTVBouquetMaker/E2m3u2bouquet provider configs via the webbrowser.

* [PFChangs](https://github.com/oottppxx/enigma2/tree/master/plugins/pfchangs) is a plugin to edit port forwarding rules from the box, via UPnP (if supported by your router).

* [PyShell](https://github.com/oottppxx/enigma2/tree/master/plugins/pyshell) is a plugin for developers/coders - it provides a very simple Python shell with access to the Enigma2 runtime environment, so small (or not so small) snippets of code can be tested and experimented with while avoiding crashes.

* [QuarterPounder](https://github.com/oottppxx/enigma2/tree/master/plugins/quarterpounder) attempts to monitor IPTV streams and restart them if they get stuck.

* [RDebrid](https://github.com/oottppxx/enigma2/tree/master/plugins/rdebrid) is a local M3U proxy for Real Debrid downloads.

* [ReStart](https://github.com/oottppxx/enigma2/tree/master/plugins/restart) is a trivial plugin that stops/starts the current service. No more need to zap out/in.

* [SnackBar](https://github.com/oottppxx/enigma2/tree/master/plugins/snackbar) is a trivial plugin that invokes the seek bar; apparently it's required as some distros have invoking the seek bar broken via hotkey.

* [Snif](https://github.com/oottppxx/enigma2/tree/master/plugins/snif) tries to detect (sniff) streaming connections to the box, extract the Basic authentication digest (namely the user), and track per user limits as configured. Note: currently the plugin only handles streams over IPv4, and it was only tested on OpenATV 6.2.

* [Subway](https://github.com/oottppxx/enigma2/tree/master/plugins/subway) is a plugin to display subscription info, if the service supports it; it should work for both XCAPI and VAPI.

Plugin release versions have 3 fields, major.minor.update, the major and minor
being numeric and the update being alfanumeric.

For most plugins, the major and minor release numbers track the corresponding fields of
the version of the OpenATV system where they were developed (currently OpenATV 6.2).

The update field is generally (but not always) some number followed by one or more
letters; numbers are bumped up when major changes are made to the code; letters are
bumped up when any fix is applied or reflect some other feature (e.g., alfa, beta).

For minor updates, the major/minor release tracking isn't expected to change, even
if the current system has evolved - let me know about innaccuracies.

Typically, the README files for each plugin/script will provide the necessary information
regarding where they were developed/tested, so one can make an educated guess if they'd
work on a particular system. In the end, there's nothing like trying it out. OpenATV and
OpenPLi are particularly targeted, but compatible distributions might also work
(e.g., WooshBuild, OpenViX, ..., just make sure they're up to date!)

If you want to bulk install all the plugins above, you can use the following command:

* wget -r 'https://oottppxx.github.io/enigma2/latest/' && for i in oottppxx.github.io/enigma2/latest/*ipk ; do opkg install $i ; done
